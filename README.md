# Loan Default Prediction & Credit Risk Modeling

This project develops advanced credit risk models to predict loan defaults using ensemble machine learning techniques. It combines Gradient Boosting Classifier and XGBoost models to achieve strong predictive performance (~82% AUC), enhancing credit risk assessment accuracy.

Key features include extensive feature engineering from transactional, credit score, and macroeconomic data, alongside anomaly detection using Isolation Forest models. The project also applies causal inference techniques such as Propensity Score Matching and Instrumental Variables to distinguish correlation from causation in factors driving defaults.

The repository contains code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation, enabling reproducibility and extension. It serves as a practical resource for financial analysts, data scientists, and ML practitioners interested in credit risk analytics, fraud detection, and applied machine learning in finance.

## Features

- Ensemble ML models optimizing default probability prediction
- Anomaly detection to identify outliers impacting risk
- Causal inference methods to strengthen factor analysis
- Detailed evaluation metrics and model tuning scripts

## Getting Started

To run the project, install required dependencies and execute the training scripts provided. Data sources include anonymized loan transactions, credit bureau scores, and relevant economic indicators.

## Usage

- Train and validate ensemble models
- Perform feature importance analysis
- Detect and investigate anomalies
- Interpret causal relationships in default drivers

## Contribution

Contributions and improvements are welcome via pull requests or issue reports.
